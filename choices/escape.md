## Good Ending  

While blocking the attack, you’ve gained the special skill dual-wielding, which allows you to hold two swords at a time. After gaining the skill, you were able to defeat the minotaur, but it appears that the minotaur was the final boss of the game. By defeating the minotaur, you have freed all the players in the world and you’re able to take off your VR headset. Not too long later, the creator of the game was arrested and all's well that ends well.
