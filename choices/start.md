## Virtual World  

You have gotten the newest MMORPG game and it is a VR game! While booting up the game, you noticed that you received an important message from the creator of the game. It says that you are trapped in the world and you canâ€™t log out of it. If you try removing the VR headset you would get a system shock making your brain fried. The only way to get out is to beat the game. When you join the world, you are in a panic and you see a fellow player. Do you join them or go solo.
